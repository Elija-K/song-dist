**Strophe**
You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope and You restore
Every heart that is broken

**mini Bridge**
Great are You, Lord

**Refrain**
'Cause it's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To You only

**Strophe**
You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope and You restore
Every heart that is broken

**mini Bridge**
Great are You, Lord

**Refrain**
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To You only

**Bridge**
And all the earth
Will shout Your praise
Our hearts will cry
These bones will sing (sing it)
Great are You, Lord

**Refrain**
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise
To You only

**Outro**
We pour out our praise
To You only
We pour out our praise
To You only
