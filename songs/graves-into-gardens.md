**Strophe 1**
I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise
And treasures that fade
Are never enough

Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire
Is now satisfied
Here in Your love (Hey)

**Chorus**
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
(Oh, yes I know it's true)

**Strophe 2**
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen 'em all
And You still call me friend

'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place
Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again

**Chorus**
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
(I know it's true)

**Chorus**
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

**Bridge 1**
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

**Bridge 1**
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

**Bridge 2**
You turn graves into garden
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can

**Chorus**
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

**Chorus**
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

**Bridge 2**
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
