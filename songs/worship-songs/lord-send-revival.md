**Strophe 1**  
Peace like a river wash over me  
Immerse me in water as deep as the sea  
Hide me in love Your healing embrace  
Peace like a river wash over me  

**Chorus**  
As I worship Your majesty  
I worship Your holy Name  
Jesus my everything  
All that I am is Yours  

**Strophe 2**  
Come Holy Spirit rain down on me  
Break open the heavens and drench the unseen  
Pour out Your presence as I pour out Your praise  
Come Holy Spirit Lord have Your way  

**Chorus**  
As I worship Your majesty  
I worship Your holy Name  
Jesus my everything  
All that I am is Yours  

**Bridge 1**  
Open the heavens  
Fling wide the gates  
Flood every heart with mercy  
Pour out Your presence Inhabit our praise  
As we cry holy holy  

**Tag 1**  
Whoa whoa  
As we cry holy holy  
Whoa whoa
